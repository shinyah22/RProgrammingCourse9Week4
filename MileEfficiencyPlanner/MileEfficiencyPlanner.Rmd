## Application Overview

- Purpose: To predict the fuel efficiency (MPG) of cars.
- Function: Users input the car's horsepower, weight, and the number of cylinders to predict MPG.

## Application Demo

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Insert Shiny application's UI components
sliderInput("horsepower", "Horsepower:", min = 50, max = 300, value = 150)
sliderInput("weight", "Weight (1000 lbs):", min = 1.5, max = 5.0, value = 3)
sliderInput("cylinders", "Number of Cylinders:", min = 4, max = 8, value = 4, step = 1)

# Shiny application's server logic
output$mpgPrediction <- renderText({
  # Implement logic to calculate MPG
  mpg <- 30 - (input$cylinders * 2) + (input$horsepower / 100) - (input$weight / 2)
  paste("Predicted MPG: ", round(mpg, digits = 2))
})

textOutput("mpgPrediction")
```

## How to Use
Move the sliders to select the horsepower, weight, and number of cylinders.
The MPG will be predicted automatically and displayed below.

## Conclusion
The "Mile Efficiency Planner" is a powerful tool for predicting the fuel efficiency of cars.
Feedback and suggestions for improvement are welcome.
